Import Libraries: Imports necessary libraries for data manipulation, model creation, and visualization.
Load and Preprocess Data: Loads the MNIST dataset, normalizes pixel values, and reshapes data for the model.
Create Model: Defines a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.
Train Model: Trains the model on the training data.
Evaluate Model: Evaluates the model's performance on the test set.
Make Predictions: Makes predictions on the test set.
Visualization (Optional): Visualizes some predictions for comparison.
Note: This is a basic example. You can experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques to improve performance.
